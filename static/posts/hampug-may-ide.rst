Talk by Peter 
I starting with using text editors. 
Eclipse - pyDev Eclipse

This is one project I have been working on lately.
You havea dir structure you have outline. 
classes you have. Various classes that you are using. code inside. It's 
very good for someone that is not a touchtyper like me
For example I have class name. Which is something with something and 
something else. There are some errors - whoopsl
Since Pyton is not compiled. It's quite handy in python.
Does it ever fail there? There are alot of things that are dynamic. 
Since i dont do dynamic binding. If you have self.
I'm not sure. Im using pycharm. 
It has all kinds of . ...
I dont know what this is. Since im not reallying using this ide . 
So the thing is

all objects 
since if you mod dict itself you are making a variable. 
Preservered. 
Eclipse has its base in Java. . If you haeve .
Familar for java developers.
Code complation.
Quick to write your own code
Then you have a loook at my variables. Its a small screen sorry.
You need a large screen for this.
ECLIPSE SUCKS. 
You can drill down, look individal ones. 
You can then. 
WHERE DID THAT GO?
Go though the project.
Some grahics coming up. 
I'm not worried about that.
That's all good. For some reason it stopped.
Longterm eclipse user.
You just accept quirts, noone knows how to fix them.

emacs. represent. editing is fine. 
You can setup run configs for various. vim or vi you have to fiddle 
with the commands.
set something before hand. it's a bit annoying
it will be fine.
you have an editor. 
go into the server. file up the file. 
It's quite 
vim setup.
and eclipse, if it crashes takes everything with you.
you can expore pref but still dedious. 
with eclipse you can support dev and pay.

- sometimes they go somewhere that doesnt 
excist.
fixing bad format. tells you if tab is wrong - blue lines on left. 
log is indented. it appears to be FONT OMG.
I never think to do this - start file. code snippits.
